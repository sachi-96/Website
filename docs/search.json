      "contents": "\nThis report provides an exploratory overview of differences in\njuvenile snowshoe hare weights for males and females at three different\nobservation sites. The sites which are located in Bonanza Creek provide\nsnowshoe hare data from 1998-2012, and the data is an important step in\ngaining more qualitative data on the prey species (Kielland et al.,\n2017.) The report also provides data comparing juvenile snowshoe hare\nhindfoot sizes and weight in grams.\nData and Analaysis\nJuvenile snowshoe hare data was collected and made available by\nDr. Knut Kielland and colleagues at the Bonanza Creek Research (LTER)\nnetwork site in Bonanza Creek, Alaska. The data contains observations\nfor 371 snowshoe hares, collected from 1998-2012. Following exploratory\ndata visualization, weight between male and female snowshoe hares are by\ntwo-sample t-tests using a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05 throughout. Differences\nbetween groups are described by Cohen’s d effect size. The\nrelationship between hindfoot length and weight is explored by simple\nlinear regression.

This can also be represented by the\nR^2 value, 0.3. The Pearson’s R Correlation, 0.55, indicates that there\nis a moderate correlation between weight and hindfoot length.\nSummary\nThe exploratory data reveals the following: - There were the most\njuvenile hares in the Bonanza Riparian site -The mean of juvenile male\nweights is significantly larger than female weights with a small effect\nsize. - The weight of juvenile snowshoe hares is linear related, however\nthe relationship is not significant. There is not direct correlation\nbetween the two variables.\nCitation Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and\nBonanza Creek LTER. 2017.

The key historic events are included as well as the changes in the\necosystem due to changing lake levels. The purple dashed line represents\nthe decrease in brine shrimp, which is the main food supply for various\nspecies of birds that rely on them (Eared Grebes and California gulls).\nThe brown line represents the emergence of land bridges that allows\npredators such as coyotes, to access major bird nesting sites. The green\nline which represents the lake level stability, shows that the lake\nlevels have become unstable in the recent years since 1975.\n\n\n\n",

This means that these two variables\nare not independent of each other. The chi -square value, (\\(\\chi\\)2(1) = 25.82) is high,\nindicating that there is a large difference between actual and expected\nvalues of the responses to both questions. This represents a significant\nassociation between the two variables. The p-value, which is\nsignificantly less than 0.001, indicates that there is sufficient\nevidence to reject the null hypothesis of independence. This means the\nalternative hypothesis that farmers awareness of NO2 being a greenhouse\ngas and whether or not they can lower emissions are dependent of each\nother, must be accepted. The table values and calculations ultimately\nshow that there is a strong association indicating farmers who are aware\nthat NO2 is a greenhouse gas are more likely to feel that they can help\nreduce emissions compared to farmers who were not aware that NO2 is a\ngreenhouse gas. The more farmers who know that NO2 is a greenhouse gas\n(66.67%), the higher percentage of them will feel they can reduce\ngreenhouse emissions (43.43%) versus farmers who did not know\n(33.33%).\nCitation Stuart, D. 2021.

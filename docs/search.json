I love animals especially dogs and cats, however I love learning about different wildlife species whether they are native or not.  I enjoy discussing topics about social injustices, racism and gender inequalities, and environmental justice!  \n\nExperience/Projects:\n  Senior year of my quantitative and qualitative Sociology course, we were selected to help the City of San Jose by collecting and analyzing data regarding littering habits in downtown San Jose.  I also used to volunteer regularly in various local environmental clubs such as Keep Coyote Creek Beautiful (KCCB) by participating in weekly trash clean ups.",

      "description": "Differences in juvenile snowshoe hare weights for males and females.\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nThis report provides an exploratory overview of differences in juvenile snowshoe hare weights for males and females at three different observation sites. The sites which are located in Bonanza Creek provide snowshoe hare data from 1998-2012, and the data is an important step in gaining more qualitative data on the prey species (Kielland et al., 2017.) The report also provides data comparing juvenile snowshoe hare hindfoot sizes and weight in grams.\nData and Analaysis\nJuvenile snowshoe hare data was collected and made available by Dr. Knut Kielland and colleagues at the Bonanza Creek Research (LTER) network site in Bonanza Creek, Alaska. The data contains observations for 371 snowshoe hares, collected from 1998-2012. Following exploratory data visualization, weight between male and female snowshoe hares are by two-sample t-tests using a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.05 throughout. Differences between groups are described by Cohen’s d effect size. The relationship between hindfoot length and weight is explored by simple linear regression. All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio version 1.3.1056.\nAnnual Juvenile Hare Trap Counts\n\n\nhide\n\n# Read in the data\nbonanza_hares_data <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"bonanza_hares.csv\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n# Create a new subset with juvenile hare trap counts that are grouped by year \njuvenile_traps <- bonanza_hares_data %>% \n  filter(age == \"j\") %>% \n  get_dupes(trap) %>% \n  mutate(date_new = mdy(date)) %>% \n  mutate(year = year(date_new)) %>% \n  group_by(year)\n\n# Create a new table to view the mean, median, sd, min and max for the previous subset\njuvenile_traps_count <- juvenile_traps %>% \n  summarize(hare_count = n()) %>% \n  summarize(mean_count = mean(hare_count, na.rm = TRUE),\n            median_count = median(hare_count, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_count = sd(hare_count, na.rm = TRUE),\n            min_count = min(hare_count, na.rn = TRUE),\n            max_count = max(hare_count, na.rn = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n# Create a histogram graph with of juvenile hare trap counts by year \nggplot(data = juvenile_traps, aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  theme_dark() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1999:2012) +\n  labs(title = \"Juvenile Hare Traps by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       caption = expression(paste(bold(\"Figure 1. \"), \"Annual Juvenile Hare Traps Statistics\"))) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.4),\n        axis.title = element_text(hjust = 0.4, vjust = 0.3),\n        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.4))\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum count of juvenile hare trappings can be seen in 2010. The maximum number of hare trappings can be represented by the year 1999.The standard deviation is close to the mean which indicates that the data points are clustered close to the mean and the distribution is not spread out very far.\nJuvenile Hare Weights\n\n\nhide\n\n# Create a subset with juvenile hare weights by full sex and full site name\nweight_sex_site <- juvenile_traps %>% \n# Rename site names \n  mutate(site_name = case_when(\n    grid == \"bonrip\" ~ \"Riparian\",\n    grid == \"bonmat\" ~ \"Mature\",\n    grid == \"bonbs\" ~ \"Black Spruce\")) %>% \n# Rename sex \n  mutate(sex = case_when(\n    sex == \"f\" ~ \"Female\",\n    sex == \"m\" ~ \"Male\",\n    is.na(sex) == TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n# Create a scatter plot of Juvenile hare weights by sex and site name\nggplot(data = weight_sex_site) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(x = sex, y = weight, color = sex )) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"magenta\", \"royalblue\", \"lightblue\"), name = \"Sex\")+\n  facet_wrap(~ site_name) +\n  labs(x = \"Sex\",\n       y = \"Juvenile Hare Weight(g)\",\n       caption = expression(paste(bold(\"Figure 2. \"), \"Juvenile Hare Weights by Sex and Site\"))) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.4),\n        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.4))\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that the Bonanza Riparian site has the most female and male juvenile hares out of all three sites. Among all three sites, there is a slightly higher number of female juvenile hares than there are male. Most juvenile hares among all three sites range from 500 grams to 1100 grams.\nJuvenile Weight Comparison (Male and Female Snowshoe Hares )\n\n\nhide\n\n# Create a new subset to find mean, standard deviation and sample size for male and female juvenile hares \nfemale_male_weight_count <- male_vs_female %>% \n  group_by(sex) %>% \n  summarize(mean_size = mean(weight),\n            sd_size = sd(weight),\n            sample_size = n())\n# Create new subset of male mean sizes and female mean size \nfemale_mean <- male_vs_female %>% \n  summarize(female_mean = mean(weight))\n\nmale_mean <- male_vs_female %>% \n  summarize(male_mean = mean(weight))\n\n# Get the mean values\nf_mean <- mean(female_mean)  \nm_mean <- mean(male_mean)\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n# Create a table of the new subset \nfemale_male_weight_count %>% \n  kable(postion = \"center\", caption = \"Statistics of Juvenile Hare Weights by Sex\", col.names = c(\"Sex\",\n                      \"Mean Size (g)\",\n                      \"Standard Deviation\",\n                      \"Sample Size (n)\")) %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE) %>% \n  kable_paper(\"striped\", full_width = F) %>% \n  row_spec (0, angle = 0) %>% \n  kable_classic_2(full_width = F)\n\n\n\nTable 1: Statistics of Juvenile Hare Weights by Sex\n\n\nSex\n\n\nMean Size (g)\n\n\nStandard Deviation\n\n\nSample Size (n)\n\n\nf\n\n\n855.2154\n\n\n293.3680\n\n\n195\n\n\nm\n\n\n942.6562\n\n\n335.2817\n\n\n160\n\n\nThe table shows the comparison of female and male weights in grams by mean, standard deviation and sample size. The actual difference of the means is NA g. The effect size (Cohen’s d) is 0.28. The outcome of an unpaired two-sample t-test is 942.66, 855.22.\nRelationship between juvenile weight & hind foot length\n\n\nhide\n\n# Create a graph of Juvenile Hindfoot Lengths and Weights\nggplot(data = weight_sex_site) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(x = hindft, y = weight)) +\n  labs(x = \"Hindfoot Length\",\n       y = \"Juvenile Hare Weight(g)\",\n       caption = expression(paste(bold(\"Figure 2.\"), \"Juvenile Hare Hindfoot Lengths by Weight(g)\"))) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.4),\n        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.4)) +\n   geom_smooth(data = weight_sex_site) + (aes(x = hindft, y = weight))\n\n\n\n\nThe slope of the linear regression model indicates that there is an uneven distribution of residuals. This can also be represented by the R^2 value, 0.3. The Pearson’s R Correlation, 0.55, indicates that there is a moderate correlation between weight and hindfoot length.\nSummary\nThe exploratory data reveals the following: - There were the most juvenile hares in the Bonanza Riparian site -The mean of juvenile male weights is significantly larger than female weights with a small effect size. - The weight of juvenile snowshoe hares is linear related, however the relationship is not significant. There is not direct correlation between the two variables.\nCitation Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER. 2017.

The key historic events are included as well as the changes in the ecosystem due to changing lake levels. The purple dashed line represents the decrease in brine shrimp, which is the main food supply for various species of birds that rely on them (Eared Grebes and California gulls). The brown line represents the emergence of land bridges that allows predators such as coyotes, to access major bird nesting sites. The green line which represents the lake level stability, shows that the lake levels have become unstable in the recent years since 1975.\n\n\n\n",

This means that these two variables are not independent of each other. The chi -square value, (\\(\\chi\\)2(1) = 25.82) is high, indicating that there is a large difference between actual and expected values of the responses to both questions. This represents a significant association between the two variables. The p-value, which is significantly less than 0.001, indicates that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of independence. This means the alternative hypothesis that farmers awareness of NO2 being a greenhouse gas and whether or not they can lower emissions are dependent of each other, must be accepted. The table values and calculations ultimately show that there is a strong association indicating farmers who are aware that NO2 is a greenhouse gas are more likely to feel that they can help reduce emissions compared to farmers who were not aware that NO2 is a greenhouse gas. The more farmers who know that NO2 is a greenhouse gas (66.67%), the higher percentage of them will feel they can reduce greenhouse emissions (43.43%) versus farmers who did not know (33.33%).\nCitation Stuart, D. 2021.

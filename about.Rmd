title: "About Sachi"
description: |
    In my spare time I enjoy going surfing, snowboarding, watching movies, going to the jiu jitsu gym, and hiking with my dogs!  I love animals especially dogs and cats, however I love learning about different wildlife species whether they are native or not.  I enjoy discussing topics about social injustices, racism and gender inequalities, and environmental justice!

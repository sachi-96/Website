F.1 This graph shows the Mono lake levels above sea level (ft) by year.  The key historic events are included as well as the changes in the ecosystem due to changing lake levels. The purple dashed line represents the decrease in brine shrimp, which is the main food supply for various species of birds that rely on them (Eared Grebes and California gulls). The brown line represents the emergence of land bridges that allows predators such as coyotes, to access major bird nesting sites. The green line which represents the lake level stability, shows that the lake levels have become unstable in the recent years since 1975.
